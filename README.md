# soccer-cli

This CLI reads a formatted text file with soccer match scores and prints the top 3 standings for each match day.

To install dependencies and run main program, use:

```bash
bun main
```

(Setup cucumber tests for BDD approach to the CLI, but ran short on time to fully build out the step definitions.)

To run cucumber tests, run: 
```bash
bun test
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v0.1.10. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
